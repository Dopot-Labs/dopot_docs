# Crowdfunding

### Basics

Each project is composed of one or more reward tiers, investing in one will grant the user a semi-fungible token representing the right to receive the corresponding product(s). The token is fungible, by being redeemable for the initial investment until the project reaches its pre-set funding goal. Then it becomes non-fungible â€” a proof of participation in the project, and its value is completely up to the market.

### Security

Project creators and investors are protected in many ways, and with the aid of a decentralized arbitration protocol and the Dopot DAO, no middlemen are required.&#x20;

Additionally, a small percentage of each crowdfunding campaign is transferred to a shared insurance-like vault; if any issue with the reward delivery arises users can open arbitrations cases and eventually receive a refund. Please note: full funds recovery might not be possible when funds in the vault are insufficient.
