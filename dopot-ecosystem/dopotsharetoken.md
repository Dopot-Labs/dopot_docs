### What is $DST?

DST is a fungible token representing a share of the DAO's liquidity. Each token is backed by a basket of assets in the treasury, a fluid portfolio managed by top community experts to seek out the most effective strategies in the ecosystem.

The DAO works to grow the intrinsic value of each DST through market participation to provide long-term value accrual.

## How it works:

To own a share of the DAO, users need to buy DST tokens from the open market or from private/public sales. These tokens can always be redeemable for the percentage owned of the total treasury.&#x20;

The DAO's economic model is based on these points:

| Expenses and Investments               | Revenue Streams                        |
