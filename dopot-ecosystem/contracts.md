# Contracts

Dopot's contracts are currently being tested on Polygon's Testnet (Mumbai), but plans are to deploy on Arbitrum One Mainnet for better security, lower fees and more DeFi integrations.

The source code is fully available and auditable on [Github](https://github.com/Dopot-Labs/dopot\_contracts).
