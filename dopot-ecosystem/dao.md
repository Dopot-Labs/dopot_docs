# DAO

### What is the Dopot DAO?

The Dopot DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization focused on growing the Dopot Protocol, managing the liquidity reserves, and ultimately adding new use-cases to the DeFi ecosystem.

## What is the mission?

Raise capital and deploy it on marketing and development for Dopot and grow the crowdfunding ecosystem together. Distribute the benefits to members and key contributors.

The DAO's economic model is based on these points:

| Expenses and Investments               | Revenue Streams                        |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Dopot Protocol updates                 | Dopot Protocol success fees            |
| Token Listings                         | Dopot Protocol deadline extension fees |
| Marketing and Participation Incentives | $DPT sales and liquidity providing     |

## Who runs the DAO? <a href="#who-runs-olympus" id="who-runs-olympus"></a>

Our token-based DAO governance is fair and secured by most attack vectors, powered by Aragon's contracts. Voting power is granted to token holders, so they can vote and propose changes, investments, and improvements.
