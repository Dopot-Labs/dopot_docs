# DAO

### What is the Dopot DAO?

The Dopot DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization focused on growing the Dopot Protocol, managing the liquidity reserves, and ultimately adding new use-cases to the DeFi ecosystem.


## What is the mission?

Raise capital and deploy it on marketing and development for Dopot and grow the crowdfunding ecosystem together. Distribute the benefits to members and key contributors.

## Who runs the DAO? <a href="#who-runs-olympus" id="who-runs-olympus"></a>

Unlike many others, our governance process is fair and secured by most attack vectors, thanks to a multisig-like DAO. Voting power is granted only to the top members and contributors of the community, so they can vote and propose changes, investments, and improvements.
