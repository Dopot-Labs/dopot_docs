# Overview

### What is Dopot?

Dopot is a decentralized crowdfunding platform that helps launch innovative products while offering discounted early access to backing users. Through a set of smart contracts and protocols, Dopot fully tokenizes the products of each project created on the platform,‌ ‌making the crowdfunding process more efficient and transparent than ever before.

Each project is composed of one or more reward tiers, investing in one will grant the user a semi-fungible token representing the right to receive the corresponding product(s). The token is fungible, by being redeemable for the initial investment until the project reaches its pre-set funding goal. Then it becomes non-fungible — a proof of participation in the project, and its value is completely up to the market.

The project creators and the investors are protected in many ways, and with the aid of a decentralized arbitration protocol and the Dopot DAO, no middlemen are required. A small percentage of each crowdfunding campaign is transferred to a shared "insurance" vault, if any issue with the reward delivery arises users can open arbitrations cases and eventually receive a refund.
